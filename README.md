# Exploring Relationships between Opioid Prescriptions and Opioid Overdose-related Fatalities in the United States of America


Step 1: Explore trends in opioid prescriptions
The Opioids dataset will be used to pull out opioid prescriptions from the Prescribers dataset.
I will examine whether particular opioids are prescribed more than others, and whether there are particular opioids that are often co-prescribed with other medications.
This will provide information about the general trends in opioid prescriptions within these datasets.

Step 2: Explore trends in prescriptions from healthcare professionals
I will use the Prescribers datasets to gather more information on the healthcare professionals that are prescribing such opioid medications.
I will examine trends on whether particular types of healthcare professionals are prescribing more opioid medications than others, and whether this varies by U.S. state.

Step 3: Develop a predictive model between opioid prescriptions and overdose fatalities
Finally, after gathering information from exploring information related to opioid medications & healthcare professionals that prescribe such compounds, I will aim to develop a predictive model (e.g., regression analysis) between opioid prescriptions and opioid-related overdose fatalities.
